                In many rural communities, home and community gardens are a mainspring of food security and nutritional well-being. These gardens provide families with easy access to fresh vegetables and fruits.  However, the stability  of these gardens are highly dependent on consistent rainfall patterns and predictable weather.
                With  climate change, rural areas are increasingly experiencing unpredictable weather conditions,  rainfall and  droughts. These changes have made it difficult for small-scale farmers and households to maintain reliable garden yields, threatening food supply, health, and household income.

                    Smallholder farmers in the Sekhukhune district, Limpopo Province, are severely affected by drought due to poor and unreliable rainfall, frequent droughts, and occasional flooding. These conditions lead to food insecurity, economic and social hardships, crop failures, livestock losses, water shortages, and reduced seed availability. The average annual rainfall has been very low, with 438 mm recorded in 1992, contributing to declining agricultural production. Drought not only harms crops and livestock but also worsens vegetation quality, leading to poor grazing conditions and further livelihood losses. Consequently, farmers face reduced income and unstable food prices.

                    Climate change has intensified droughts, floods, and unpredictable rainfall, yet drought risk management—especially in agriculture—remains poorly developed. Agricultural drought, the least studied type, poses serious economic challenges. This study examines its impacts on small businesses in South Africa’s Free State Province, which faces severe, widespread drought conditions.

                Unpredictable rainfall and frequent droughts are significantly undermining the sustainability of food gardens in rural areas. These gardens are more than just a source of food , they are a foundation for household health, economic security, and community resilience. Addressing this challenge requires collaborative efforts from government, NGOs, and local communities to ensure that rural food gardens remain a reliable resource amid a changing climate.
